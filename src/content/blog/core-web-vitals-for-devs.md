# Technical SEO for Developers

In the modern web era, SEO is no longer just about keywords; it's about **performance**. As developers, we hold the keys to how search engines perceive and rank our applications.

## Why Performance is the New SEO

Google's Core Web Vitals have shifted the focus towards user experience. If your site is slow, your content won't matter.

### Key Metrics to Watch:

1. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Measuring loading performance.
2. **FID (First Input Delay)**: Measuring interactivity.
3. **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Measuring visual stability.
