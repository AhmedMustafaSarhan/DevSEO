# Technical SEO for Developers

In the world of modern web development, SEO is no longer just about content; it's about **User Experience (UX)**. Google now uses performance metrics to determine where your site stands.

## What are Core Web Vitals?

As developers, we need to focus on three main pillars:

1. **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: How fast the main content loads.
2. **FID (First Input Delay)**: How responsive the page is to user clicks.
3. **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: How stable the layout is during loading.

## How Astro Helps

By using a framework like **Astro**, we minimize the JavaScript sent to the browser, which automatically boosts our SEO scores without extra effort.
